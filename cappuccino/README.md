## Description
Cappuccino is a social media app that allows users to share their ideas on a collaborative message board. Regular users can view posts from others, as well as create, edit, and delete their own posts. Admin users have additional privileges, including the ability to delete any user's posts. Additionally, all users can access the weekly weather forecast for their local area, making Cappuccino a platform that combines creativity and practical information.

## Functionality
* <b>User Accounts:</b>
    * <i>Normal User:</i> can view posts, create posts, and delete or edit only their own posts
    * <i>Admin User:</i> has additional privileges to delete any user's posts

* <b>Database:</b> <i>Elephant SQL</i>

* <b>Interactive UI:</b> <i>React</i>

* <b>Library or framework not discussed in class:</b>
    * <i>Tailwind CSS</i>
    * <i>Styled-Components</i>
    * <i>JWT Decode</i>
    * <i>JavaScript XML (JSX)</i>: syntax extension for JavaScript used in React
    * <i>Figma</i>: used for prototyping and UI/UX design

* <b>Outside REST API:</b> <i>OpenWeatherMap API</i>
    * provides detailed weather forecasts based on the user's geographic location

## Technical Stack
### Database:
Elephant SQL
* DB_NAME=sfctizgx
* DB_USER=sfctizgx
* DB_PASS=oPSR69xCjlCIOqykl_HiH8rRtdw2h_wU
* DB_HOST=peanut.db.elephantsql.com
* DB_PORT=5432
* PORT=5001
* JWT_SECRET=TeamCappuccino22

<b>Tables</b>
* <u>Users Table:</u>
    * <b>id (integer):</b> Primary key that uniquely identifies each user.
    * <b>username (varchar):</b> Stores the username of the user.
    * <b>password (varchar):</b> Stores the hashed password of the user for authentication purposes.

* <u>Posts Table:</u>
    * <b>id (integer):</b> Primary key that uniquely identifies each post.
    * <b>title (varchar):</b> The title of the post.
    * <b>body (text):</b> The content of the post.
    * <b>user_id (integer):</b> Foreign key referencing the id column in the users table, establishing a relationship between a post and its author.
    * <b>likes (integer):</b> Stores the number of likes a post has received.

<b>Relationships</b>
* There is a one-to-many relationship between the users table and the posts table:
Each user can create multiple posts (one user â†’ many posts).
* The user_id column in the posts table links each post to its respective user in the users table.


### Backend:

For full deatils, see: [structure.md](backend/structure.md)

<b>Routes:</b>

* <u>auth.js file</u>
    * <b>POST /auth/signup</b> - Register a new user
    * <b>POST /auth/login</b> - Log in an existing user and generate a token

* <u>posts.js file</u>

    * <b>POST /posts/</b> - Create a new post
    * <b>GET /posts/</b> - Get all posts
    * <b>GET /posts/:id</b> - Get a specific post by ID
    * <b>PUT /posts/:id</b> - Update a specific post by ID
    * <b>DELETE /posts/:id</b> - Delete a specific post by ID
    * <b>GET /posts/user/:username</b> - Get all posts by a specific username

### Front End:

* <u>Framework</u>
    * <b>React:</b> The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
* <u>Styling</u>
    * <b>Tailwind CSS:</b> Used for styling the application with a utility-first CSS framework, enabling rapid development of responsive designs.
    * <b>Styled-Components:</b> Employed for scoped CSS-in-JS styling, ensuring modular and maintainable styles for React components.

* <u>Prototyping</u>
    * <b>Figma:</b>The user interface was designed and prototyped in Figma to visualize the app's layout and user experience before development.

* <u>Routing</u>
    * <b>React Router:</b> Implemented for navigating between pages like login, idea boards, and user profiles seamlessly.

* <b>API Integration:</b>
Integrated with the backend using RESTful APIs to manage authentication, user ideas, and the weather forecast feature.

### Weather API:

The API functionality implemented in our app fetches and displays detailed weather forecasts based on the user's current geographic location. It uses the <b>OpenWeatherMap API</b> to retrieve a 5-day weather forecast, broken into 3-hour intervals. Our app only displays the next 24 hours. The system first retrieves the user's geolocation using the browser's navigator.geolocation API to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates. These coordinates are then sent to a helper function, which interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data. <https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&appid=${apiKey}&units=imperial>

The app uses three key states (weather, error, and loading) to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface. Users can click a button to fetch their local weather, with a spinner displayed during the loading process. The forecast includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility, accompanied by intuitive icons (e.g., cloudy, sunny, partly cloudy) for easy visualization.
